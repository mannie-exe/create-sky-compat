# Skyweave: Compatibility Patches 0.22.1

Configuration now groups mod pages by gameplay system, with localized search and
measured section navigation. One ordered definition drives the sidebar and page
content. Inline JSON and registered TOML controls stage edits until Save, validate
values, preserve external edits and report partial saves. Single-option forms no
longer open separate screens. Outlined groups, yellow selection and a text-only
Unicode information action improve the hierarchy.

Optional SSRD/Sable/Iris adapters restore distant construct visibility with
shaders. A separate DH adapter repairs opaque-terrain occlusion. Extend selected
backfaces to Macaw's mosaic glass, caramel bricks, bubble gum, ornate grates and
industrial grating. Flat bridge lantern selection and collision now match the
pack's model; the approved hanging stair lantern remains intact.

Terrain placement and generation identity are unchanged. These integrations retain
independent startup switches, dependency checks and physical-side exclusions.

`./gradlew --no-daemon check build clientProbeJar` passes 161 Java tests and the
tooling, resource, upstream and packaging checks. The POSIX directory-permission fixture runs only on supported filesystems;
Windows skips that fixture. Native full/minimum clients verified configuration behavior; native rendering and collision checks retain
their documented scope. See [verification](docs/development/verification.md) for
versions and remaining limits, and [configuration](docs/configuration.md) for
ownership and application timing. Previous release: [0.21.1](docs/releases/0.21.1.md).
