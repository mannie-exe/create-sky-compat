# Skyweave: Compatibility Patches 0.23.1

Preserve connected-pane edge culling before adding interior backfaces. Fusion now
finishes its pane modifiers before Compat wraps Minecraft's pane models, so
stacked panes no longer expose horizontal strips at their shared edges. Connected
textures, exposed edges and different-material boundaries retain their native
behavior. The existing Fusion backface switch controls this repair; no new setting
is required.

This is a client rendering correction. Terrain generation, saved worlds, LODs and
other adaptations are unchanged. Pair it with Create: Skyweave 0.3.1 for the separate
Visual Patches correction to connected-pane lighting.

Native checks cover red and magenta pane walls, Create and Macaw controls, partial
connections, different-color boundaries, resource reload and shaders off/on. The
owner also accepted the combined changes in the playing client. See
[verification](docs/development/verification.md#connected-pane-edges) for the exact
fixture and remaining coverage limits.

Previous release: [0.23.0](docs/releases/0.23.0.md).
