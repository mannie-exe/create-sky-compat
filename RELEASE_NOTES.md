# Skyweave: Compatibility Patches 0.23.0

Skyweave Islands now targets **Sky Archipelago 1.4**. Native exterior shaping,
rivers, lakes and water-archetype profiles replace the superseded taper and water
backends. Sparse displaced clusters, varied elevations, independent NOISE/HOLLOW
interiors, island-relative geology, ores and large iron/copper veins remain.
Floating ocean extensions stay opt-in; the global ocean stays disabled.

Ancient Cities fit inside islands with configurable exterior burial and separate
core/floor checks. Bounded, piece-aware clearance reuses vanilla's Beardifier
without excavating a single rectangular hall. It retains the island shell,
foundations, authored water beds and existing HOLLOW room. Nearby ordinary and
Sky Villages may coexist. Cave-biome physical queries retain island ownership;
water-structure lookup supports floating water hosts with the global ocean off.

An optional Surveyor adaptation ignores invalid structure starts before they
reach its map recorder. Generation, interior and ocean startup readers now reject
duplicate JSON keys just as the configuration editor does. River/lake controls
use the native codec and the existing nested configuration form.

**Use a fresh world for the new generator.** Existing marked saves reject an
incompatible generation identity. Keep their original mod/settings or preserve
those saves before creating another world; no automatic terrain or LOD migration
is provided. Other integrations retain their independent switches and side gates.

Completed single-column queries can be substantially slower than the previous
generator; bulk filling uses native snapshots. Targeted checks do not establish
ore scarcity, aquatic progression or complete native biome-locate discovery.
See [verification](docs/development/verification.md) for exact tested artifacts,
native cases and limits, and [configuration](docs/configuration.md) for settings
and application timing. Previous release: [0.22.1](docs/releases/0.22.1.md).
