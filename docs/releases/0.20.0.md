# Skyweave Compat 0.20.0

- Rename the independently installable mod to Skyweave Compat, with mod ID `skyweave_compat`, package `design.inherent.skyweavecompat`, and canonical repository `mannie-exe/skyweave-compat`.
- Rename configuration files, resources, translations, integration packs, probes, and release artifacts together. Skyweave's civilization mod is not a dependency.
- Require a fresh world for the new registry identity. Existing Create Sky Compat saves must stay on their original release; legacy generation markers are rejected, including with terrain disabled. Never rename or remove a marker to force conversion.
- Preserve terrain algorithms, numerical profiles, interior noise salts, and DH's existing cache identity. Minecraft 1.21.1, NeoForge 21.1.264, and optional integration pins are unchanged.

Automated build/package checks, minimum and full dedicated-server startup, and minimum/full fresh-world generation with reopening passed. Native client verification for this renamed artifact is pending; earlier rendering observations apply to their recorded releases. See [verification](docs/development/verification.md).
