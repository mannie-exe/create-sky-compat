# Radio playback synchronization

`analog_audio.playback_timeline` is a physical-client adaptation for Analog Audio
0.1.5-hotfix.1 and its bundled AnalogLib 0.1.0. It does not require Create or the
separate radio movement-registration repair. Other AnalogLib consumers retain
their native playback behavior.

## Timeline and ownership

Analog Audio supplies a cassette identity, URL, start tick, duration and loop
state. `RadioSessions` samples the current level's media time on the game thread.
Emitters from the same cassette session share a clock; a changed URL or start tick
gets a different session. The registry retains at most 512 emitters and clears on
world teardown. Removing the last emitter invalidates its clock and callbacks.

`NativeTimelineMixin` compares that clock with queued audio and the OpenAL sample
cursor. It discards stale queued sound when playback falls more than 250 ms
behind, while allowing the existing decoder to catch up. Decoded audio still
comes from AnalogLib's native FFmpeg/yt-dlp pipeline. An ahead-of-timeline source
waits for the game clock rather than changing pitch or playback rate.

Standby streams bind to the current clock before resuming. AnalogLib's existing
offset check decides whether to reuse a stream or load it again; loading time is
then accounted for in either case. Replacement and resolver submission share a
streamer lock so an obsolete request cannot start after a newer replacement or
stop operation. Token, error and completion callbacks return to the game thread
and check the current session before changing engine state.

Initial internet loading can remain silent. This joins the current position after
loading; it does not promise identical first-sound timing or sample-perfect
playback between computers. Native pause, playlist and loop authority remain in
Analog Audio. Independent cassette start times no longer merge through the
library's tolerance window.

## Range and sound controls

This adaptation does not change volume, attenuation, filtering, stereo mode,
emitter positioning or OpenAL distance properties. Configure native radio and
speaker ranges in Analog Audio's server configuration. A larger range extends
the existing quieter tail; disabling spatial audio can retain native range
limitations. Server view distance is not an attenuation control.

## Updating dependencies

Inspect the exact bundled AnalogLib JAR, not an older public playback backend.
Update the outer and nested artifact hashes together. Review radio/client-hook
signatures, stream clustering and standby ownership, token and completion
callbacks, native queue accounting, sample rate/chunk size, pipeline generation
checks and OpenAL context ownership before changing the version gate.

Run the delayed-load comparison, two clients with insertion roles swapped,
range exit/re-entry, pause/resume, loops, replacement, reconnect and one supported
online cassette. Measure audible queue positions; decoder progress and a
`playing` flag alone are insufficient. Retire the corresponding hooks when a
released upstream implementation preserves the same timeline and lifecycle.

See [verification](verification.md) for tested artifacts and limits.
