# Hoofprint zoom investigation

Reviewed 2026-10-31 for Minecraft 1.21.1. Status: source and released-bytecode
inspection; the adapter below is proposed, not implemented or tested in game.

## Configuration limits

Skyweave pins [Hoofprint 1.3.0+1.21](https://modrinth.com/mod/hoofprint/version/YQxLELnA)
and Surveyor 1.2.4+1.21, using Connector and Forgified Fabric API on NeoForge.
The inspected Hoofprint JAR has SHA-256
`9078d6e61a0730712607f0791fc2243517c95d742134b6dc0b1d2912513f30cb`.
Its SHA-1 matches the pack pin, `d2395ad821239db36507fc6946d185fd10e81d3c`.

The pack already sets `defaultScale = -1` in `config/hoofprint.toml`.
The field's declared integer range is -1 through 10. It controls opening zoom,
not the scroll limits. With `G` as the window GUI scale, initialization selects:

| Configuration | Internal map scale `p` | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-1` | `ceil(G / 2)` | Approximately half the GUI scale, rounded up |
| `0` | `ceil(G)` | Match GUI scale |
| `1` through `10` | The configured integer | Fixed display pixels per block |

For example, at GUI scale 4 the existing default starts at 2 display pixels per
block; `defaultScale = 1` starts twice as far out without changing GUI scale.
At GUI scale 1 or 2, `-1` already selects 1, so that change buys nothing.
`defaultScale = 10` starts at the closest existing zoom. Neither setting expands
the range available by scrolling.

`HoofprintScreen` stores `guiScale` as an integer. Its vertical scroll handler
increments/decrements it by one and stops at 1 and 10. `getScaleFactor()` returns
`p / G`; Minecraft's GUI transform then restores `G`, making the effective
terrain scale `p` display pixels per block. The terrain span at a fixed window
size is therefore independent of the selected GUI scale at either endpoint.
These are Hoofprint limits, not a vanilla camera/FOV limit.

`-2` is outside the declared config range. Even if forced past validation, the
initialization expression treats every negative value other than `-1` like `0`;
it does not interpret successive negatives as more zoom-out. Allowing zero as
the internal map scale would cause divisions by zero in the coordinate helpers.
`dimensions.scales` controls interdimension coordinate ratios and player markers;
it is not a minimum/maximum zoom setting.

Evidence: upstream revision
[`78225fdb0bd99eb32fe90f55c75df42f7216a2bd`](https://github.com/HestiMae/hoofprint/tree/78225fdb0bd99eb32fe90f55c75df42f7216a2bd),
whose metadata identifies 1.3.0 on branch 1.21. Inspect
[`HoofprintConfig.java`](https://github.com/HestiMae/hoofprint/blob/78225fdb0bd99eb32fe90f55c75df42f7216a2bd/src/main/java/garden/hestia/hoofprint/HoofprintConfig.java#L20)
and [`HoofprintScreen.java`](https://github.com/HestiMae/hoofprint/blob/78225fdb0bd99eb32fe90f55c75df42f7216a2bd/src/main/java/garden/hestia/hoofprint/HoofprintScreen.java)
(`init`, `changeDim`, `mouseScrolled`, `getScaleFactor`, and coordinate helpers).
The released JAR's annotations and those scale paths were also inspected with
`javap -p -c` / `javap -p -c -v`; conclusions do not rely on branch names alone.

## Proposed Skyweave: Compatibility Patches adapter

Use an independently selectable, physical-client-only adaptation, tentatively
`hoofprint.zoom`. Gate it through `FeatureSelection` and `OptionalMixinPlugin`
before resolving Hoofprint classes. Pin the exact Hoofprint version and artifact;
require the tested Connector/Surveyor stack when active. Disabled or absent
Hoofprint must select no target mixins and impose no target version constraint.
No terrain-preset prerequisite or server hook is needed.

Keep a separate positive floating-point map scale in the screen mixin, rather
than changing the upstream integer field's type. Override `getScaleFactor()` to
return that scale divided by the window GUI scale. Existing drawing, panning,
inspection and waypoint coordinate helpers already consume this method.
Do not write Minecraft's GUI scale or change Surveyor's saved terrain.

Replace vertical scroll handling with bounded multiplicative zoom, retaining
the world position under the pointer. For each axis, capture its world position
before changing scale, then add `before - after` to the map center. This works
for fractional scales; the original integer-step center adjustment does not.
Handle small trackpad deltas, ignore horizontal-only input and reject nonfinite
input. Clamp finite positive minimum, initial and maximum values coherently.
Candidate limits of 1/8 through 32 display pixels per block would allow eight
times the current widest span and 3.2 times the current closest magnification;
these are illustrative tuning values, not accepted defaults or performance claims.

Initialize the new scale after upstream `init`; define reopening behavior and
preserve zoom/center through resize so GUI reinitialization cannot reset the
extension unexpectedly. Also adapt `changeDim`: upstream converts the center
by the dimension ratio and truncates/clamps its integer zoom back to 1..10.
Retain center conversion, but apply the inverse ratio to the floating-point
scale within the new limits; dimensions with zero coordinate scale should keep
zoom. Changing only the scroll constants or config annotation cannot supply
fractional zoom-out and would leave this reset path intact.

Before implementation is considered verified, inspect Connector's remapped
target names and method descriptors. The original 1.21 JAR uses intermediary
names (`method_25426()V` for `init`, `method_25401(DDDD)Z` for scrolling), while
Hoofprint-owned helpers retain their names. A NeoForge mixin must target the
actual transformed class; do not assume Yarn names or raw intermediary names
will work unchanged. The existing ModDev client limitation with Connector is
recorded in [client probes](README.md#client-probes).

## Verification requirements

Implementation checks must cover applied mixins in a disposable Connector client,
both zoom endpoints at multiple unchanged GUI scales, pointer anchoring, dragging,
waypoint placement/selection, block inspection, cave mode, dimension round trips,
resize and reopening. Verify minimum installation, absent target, disabled target,
unsupported-but-disabled target and dedicated-server isolation, plus the required
`./gradlew check build` on the implemented snapshot.

Extreme zoom-out also needs a representative large explored-map performance check.
The inspected screen scans stored region textures, culls nonvisible rectangles,
and draws visible 512-by-512 region textures; it has no multiresolution terrain
selection. A wider view can draw many more regions and overlapping markers.
See [`HoofprintMapStorage.java`](https://github.com/HestiMae/hoofprint/blob/78225fdb0bd99eb32fe90f55c75df42f7216a2bd/src/main/java/garden/hestia/hoofprint/HoofprintMapStorage.java).
A zoom adapter should only project existing Surveyor data, without generating
chunks, changing map discovery, or promising that server pregeneration makes
all terrain available to Hoofprint.
