# BlueMap adaptation

The optional adapter changes BlueMap 5.7's browser presentation of saved Sky
Archipelago terrain. It does not generate chunks, modify gameplay or write map
tiles. BlueMap itself is not a required dependency and is not needed on clients.
[Configuration](../configuration.md#bluemap-viewer) owns map selection and budgets.

## Loading and world selection

The entrypoint checks the physical dedicated-server side and exact BlueMap 5.7
loader metadata before resolving API-bearing classes. The dependency is
compile-only. API enable/disable callbacks publish or clear an adapter manifest;
server lifecycle callbacks capture the canonical Overworld save path and actual
height bounds on Minecraft's thread. Expanded worlds must already have their
verified generation marker. Only explicitly selected map IDs whose save path
matches that Sky Archipelago world are published. Ordinary Sky Archipelago worlds
use their own dimension bounds; foreign generators are excluded.

The adapter registers `create-sky-compat/viewer.js` through BlueMap's webapp API.
Schema 2 settings include per-map exclusive height bounds. API reload and server
shutdown clear selection. The original renderer returns when selection is empty,
settings are invalid or the supported browser implementation is unavailable.

## Rendering and limits

The detailed render pass extends BlueMap's camera-distance cutoff while retaining
its floating-origin transform. Loading uses the actual vertical bounds for
frustum tests, a bounded tile radius and concurrent-request limit. Retained
vertex/index buffer usage reduces the radius when the budget is reached. An
individual oversized tile falls back to coarse rendering. This is not a total
browser/GPU memory limit: textures, pending downloads and temporary allocations
are additional costs.

The finest coarse layer removes triangles touching transparent samples. Alpha
indicates occupancy; zero height does not. Coarser layers retain upstream geometry
because removing every partially empty triangle can erase whole distant islands.
Detailed geometry includes stacked surfaces and undersides only if BlueMap's
server-side render settings retained them. Coarse data remains a height field.
The adapter cannot reconstruct missing surfaces, and coarse sheets and distorted
edges can remain visible from below or beyond the detailed area.

Detach restores methods and shader sources and disposes owned geometry. It keeps
captured manager references because BlueMap clears its manager properties before
notifying listeners of a map change. `window.createSkyBlueMap.metrics` exposes
activity, radius, retained geometry and fallback reason for browser inspection.

## Upstream boundaries

The API is public; the renderer hooks are version-specific internals. Java verifies
the 5.7 web bundle's size and SHA-256 before publishing the adapter; the browser
also checks the bundle URL, manager shape and shader signature. Compilation pins
and the exact upstream JAR hash live in `build.gradle`. The adapted render loop
retains BlueMap's MIT notice.

For an update, review upstream
[MapViewer](https://github.com/BlueMap-Minecraft/BlueMap/blob/v5.7/common/webapp/src/js/MapViewer.js),
TileManager, low-resolution loaders/shaders and API lifecycle. Update the metadata,
artifact and bundle gates together only after native and browser checks. Confirm
signed heights, occupancy, floating-origin movement, request/memory bounds,
map switching, reload and detach. Do not raise memory defaults to hide fallback
limitations or clear existing tiles for a browser-only change.

## Verification tools

Build with `./gradlew check build`. Verify the no-BlueMap boundary with the minimal
native generation command in [development](README.md). Then run:

```sh
python3 tools/bluemap_probe.py --server /path/to/server/game --java /path/to/java
```

This uses disposable dedicated servers with only Sky Archipelago, Compat and
BlueMap. It checks expanded/ordinary bounds, foreign-generator exclusion, reload
selection and shutdown cleanup. It reuses the installed libraries and accepted
Minecraft resource download without editing the source instance.

For browser inspection against existing saved tiles:

```sh
python3 tools/bluemap_preview.py --web /path/to/game/bluemap/web --port 8101
```

The loopback preview is read-only and substitutes the candidate script/settings.
It assumes expanded bounds by default; set `--min-y` and `--max-y` for another
world. It bypasses native selection deliberately, so it cannot verify API loading.
Stop it after inspection. Current observations are recorded in
[verification](verification.md#bluemap-adapter).
