# Transmission & Linkage

The optional interaction adapter targets Transmission & Linkage 0.2.9 with
Create 6.0.10, Sable 2.0.6 and Simulated 1.3.2. It does not require the terrain
preset. [Configuration](../configuration.md#adaptation-switches) owns activation.

## Player mutations

`transmission_linkage.interactions` retains upstream targeting, movement remapping,
physics and saved links. Visible rods detach through sneak-use with a Create
wrench in the main hand. Ordinary attack input no longer sends an instant removal
packet, and bare-hand sneak-use on a head no longer detaches it. Native
sneak-wrench removal of an endpoint still recovers the block through upstream's
drop path.

Server hooks validate rod removal, menu changes, endpoint use and the resolved
selection when binding. Requests need a current editable endpoint; linked changes
also require the opposite endpoint to be available and editable. Adventure and
spectator mutation is rejected. Packet edits retain upstream menu and target
checks and recheck menu validity before mutation. Physics breakage and automatic
lifecycle cleanup remain upstream behavior and do not impersonate a player.

Checks include ordinary spawn protection at the Sable plot and projected world
positions, and break events for deliberate removals. `LinkageEditEvent` provides
a cancellable authorization hook for every affected endpoint; it exposes the
player, endpoint, projected position and removal flag. Settings checks do not
post synthetic right-click events, which could trigger unrelated interactions. Unloaded targets are not
force-loaded to authorize a request. This is not a guarantee of compatibility
with every protection mod: integrations that maintain additional ownership or
custom claim APIs need their own verification. Protection cancellation leaves
both ends and held rod quantities unchanged.

`transmission_linkage.jade` requires the interaction adapter and Jade
15.10.6+neoforge. It reports server link availability, endpoint-center separation
and target length; details include giant-cylinder set pressure/flow and regulator
control. These settings are not evidence of a supplied fluid network or measured
fluid consumption. Conversion bearings expose their separate native output object's
RPM and total SU, plus the actual cached suppression cause; reading those values
does not run another structure scan.

## Upstream limits

The inspected source is
[`bd1f0bf`](https://github.com/userenxv/aeronautics-utility-objects/tree/bd1f0bfe3a9cc2c8275eb44cd5883a16c854f9e3).
The release artifact is pinned by version ID and SHA-256 in Gradle. Version 0.2.9
already repairs Ponder interference and rod targeting through physics structures;
these adapters do not duplicate those changes.

The giant-rod visual helper caps visible extension at 18.0625 blocks. Stock
maximum link length 15 and break distance 17 avoid the enlarged-configuration
case described in [upstream issue 5](https://github.com/userenxv/aeronautics-utility-objects/issues/5).
Do not enlarge the range without aligning rendering, selection bounds and
physical length. No range extension is implemented here.

## Checks and updates

`tools/linear_probe.py --scenario linkage --linkage /path/to/0.2.9.jar` reuses the
isolated machinery runner. Supply its normal read-only server, pack, Java and
Linear Bearing inputs. `--minimal` selects the reduced Create/Sable runtime;
`--linkage-baseline` disables these adapters for the original-behavior control.
The fixture uses a real world-to-assembled-body rod and native packet handlers.
It records artifact/source hashes and deletes its temporary world.

The baseline permits bare removal. The adapted fixture rejects bare removal,
adventure/spectator removal, a protected opposite endpoint, unauthorized settings
and a stale distant menu, while allowing authorized settings and sneak-wrench
removal. This check does not establish interactive client input, every lifecycle
transition, claim-mod coverage or multiplayer packet ordering.

`--scenario linkage-physics` is a bounded native observation of normal and giant
actuators and an independently driven converter. It reports observations rather
than asserting a balanced power economy or a closed-loop exploit. Read the
recorded configuration and fixture alongside measurements.

Before updating upstream, inspect packet lambdas, menu checks, block/wrench use,
binding call sites and remapped selection locals. The authorization injections
depend on these exact released shapes. Update compile hashes, feature gates and
native positive/denied controls together. Verify dedicated-server loading and
client rod input separately; neither successful compilation nor one fixture
proves both. Retire an individual hook only when the selected upstream release
provides the complete corresponding behavior. Do not suppress an upstream repair
merely to retain this adapter.

The lifecycle scene (`--scenario linkage-lifecycle`) saves and cold-reopens three
real links: ordinary world-to-ship, reversed-order giant actuation, and a rotated
off-center ship-to-ship pair. It also assembles an already linked endpoint and
checks isolated endpoint removal. Each surviving pair must have one live rod
constraint. This does not establish every hinge layout or mid-session chunk
unload order. Stock actuation and powered-regulator semantics remain upstream
behavior; the adapter introduces no fuel or kinetic-input requirement.
