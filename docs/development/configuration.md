# Configuration interface

[Operator configuration](../configuration.md#configuration-interface) owns the
navigation, controls, filenames and application timing. This guide owns the
implementation boundaries and update checks.

## Navigation and layout

`SettingsCatalog` assigns each feature to one gameplay system and mod group.
`Page` merges groups sharing a system and mod; the same mod can have a separate
page in another system. Features and files retain one data owner. Each page declares one ordered list of purpose sections and typed items: fixes,
preferences, file settings and shader actions. Navigation/search and content walk
that same composition, so section count, anchors and ordering cannot drift through
independent page builders. Old physical-side groups supply metadata only. A section
is not necessarily file-backed. Purpose and application timing are separate; omit
empty/unavailable sections rather than inventing headings for every page.
The catalog contains no optional API classes. Add catalog metadata and English strings when
introducing a setting; navigation must not introduce another activation switch.

`FeatureSelection` remains authoritative for dependencies, versions, sides and
prerequisites. The interface translates its inactive reasons without repeating
the selection logic. Physical side appears in Details, not as the primary tree.

`ConfigurationOverview` owns page routes, expanded groups, localized search,
per-page bookmarks/focus, explicit selected destinations, and the staged save set. `SettingsSearch` matches resolved
strings with case and diacritic normalization; IDs are secondary matches. JSON
field descriptions and registered specs participate without searching file
contents or values. Localized mod names determine page order inside each system;
authored section order and owning schemas determine setting order. JSON field
order comes from the owned definition, independent of saved key formatting.
Registered scalar fields are real inline destinations. Journal controls keep their
existing shared preference helpers; their file does not produce duplicate controls.

Search uses Minecraft's `EditBox`, retained across result filtering and layout
rebuilds. Its responder also runs on cursor/selection movement; ignore unchanged
text and replace only the navigation results when filtering. Recreating the input
here loses selection, horizontal scrolling and clipboard-editing state. Respect
native Command shortcuts on macOS and Control elsewhere; do not add another
string editor or global key interception. Preserve a restored focus owner instead
of advancing it again through initial Tab navigation after a rebuild.

A clicked destination uses vanilla `ChatFormatting.YELLOW` in the navigation and
its content title. It remains the sole explicit content highlight until another
destination is chosen; scroll/bookmark tracking remains separate. Ordinary titles
use WHITE and descriptions/category text use GRAY. Feature details use a plain
lowercase `i`, with `minecraft:uniform` applied only to that glyph. Its transparent
button has a normal hit target, yellow hover/focus text, underline, localized
tooltip and explicit narration. Other labels keep the ordinary Minecraft font.

`SettingsPanel` measures rows and optional two-column field pairs. Those same
bounds drive drawing, clipping, hit testing, focus scrolling and section anchors.
Ordinary native widgets retain keyboard behavior and narration. Columns appear
only when both meet the minimum measured width; complex list rows span the pane.
Purpose groups use unfilled, clipped DARK_GRAY outlines interrupted by their
measured eyebrow headings. Group padding participates in the same column/anchor
measurements; borders do not create another input or scroll owner.

`SectionNavigation` keeps an explicitly chosen clamped destination until scrolling
moves. Bookmarks preserve section-relative offsets; an end bookmark stays at the
end when columns or wrapped text change the document height. Stable route/control
keys restore page focus after rebuilds and auxiliary screens.

Native pointer dispatch assigns focus after invoking a button callback. A callback
can rebuild the widgets, leaving focus on a detached control. The overview repairs
that root ownership after dispatch. Preserve this distinction: a widget's focused
flag alone does not establish keyboard routing. `ClientResourceRevision` invalidates
measurements after resource/font reloads without changing gameplay state.

## File ownership

| Owner | Files and authority |
| --- | --- |
| `StartupEdits` | Feature properties; immutable running selection plus next-start delta |
| `JsonEdits` / `JsonSettings` | Five cataloged strict JSON files; actual profile/settings parsers validate every candidate |
| `RegisteredEdits` | Staged scalar fields in loaded local NeoForge CLIENT/COMMON TOMLs; native specs, serializer and reload events |
| `JournalPreferences` | Immediate journal values shared with the journal bookmark |
| `ShaderAssembly` | Existing recipe/rebuild workflow; not a general file editor |

`JsonSettings` uses only pure profile types and parsers. The generation JSON parser
is separated into `ProfileJson` because the generator adapter's API signatures
reference optional Sky Archipelago classes. Do not introduce such signatures into
classes loaded by minimum installations.

Owned JSON currently requires flat numbers/booleans and BlueMap's map-ID string
list. Numeric drafts retain exact text, including invalid values. Full profile
constructors enforce integer types, bounds and cross-field invariants. The bounded
JSON reader rejects duplicate keys and trailing documents. Owned strict files are
pretty-printed on save; comments and unknown fields are not supported by their
runtime schema. Missing or malformed files are distinct from defaults. Opening a
screen never manufactures configuration.

`ConfigFile` provides bounded UTF-8 snapshots and trusted catalog filenames under
the local config directory. It rejects traversal, symlinks, nonregular files and
input above 128 KiB. There are no persistent handles, locks or watchers and no
per-frame file parsing. Read at open, explicit reload, registered readback and save.

Owned-file saves compare the captured baseline, validate output, write a same-dir
temporary file, preserve POSIX permissions where supported, recheck the baseline,
and atomically replace. Unsupported atomic moves fail without an in-place
truncation fallback. Readback must match and validate before the draft clears.
Writers from this implementation serialize briefly per canonical path. These
comparisons cannot provide cross-process compare-and-swap against noncooperating
external writers; a narrow final-check/rename race remains.

Properties serialization replaces only edited logical properties, preserving
unrelated comments, escapes, continuations, ordering and line endings where
possible. Explicit false values and omitted defaults keep their loader semantics.

`SettingsCommit` preflights the complete pending set before the first write. It
then reports committed files and the first failure. Each successful owner clears
its own draft; failed/unattempted drafts remain. It does not promise a multi-file
transaction or roll files back over possible external edits.

## Registered scalar forms

Only cataloged, actually loaded CLIENT/COMMON files whose resolved local path
matches the config root qualify. Remote SERVER config caches are never targets.
`RegisteredEdits` discovers scalar bindings through `ModConfigSpec`; field labels
reuse explicit spec translations or NeoForge's mod-ID/configuration fallback.
Native validators/defaults/ranges and restart types remain authoritative.
Single-field files render as their field rather than adding another file heading
and sidebar destination. File inspection remains in Status & files. Village
cross-field validation reuses the runtime `NeighborRule.Settings` invariant.
Unsupported shapes are reported, not silently flattened or guessed.

Edits remain local drafts without mutating native values or writing per keystroke.
They join the existing Save/Discard/Reload scope. A save validates the candidate,
compares bounded disk and registered-value snapshots, then briefly applies changed
bindings and calls the owning spec's `save()`. NeoForge keeps its serializer,
comments, reload events, watcher and restart-cache contracts. These files are not
serialized by the JSON writer. Readback must validate and match intended values.

If writing fails while the file remains at its baseline, restore only edited
native bindings that still match this attempt; retain the draft. If disk contains
the intended values but a later reload callback failed, report a written-file
warning and keep those saved values rather than rolling them back. Unexpected
external readback retains the draft for review. This is optimistic coordination,
not a lock over native watchers or arbitrary external processes.

Registered immediate values apply after Save; world/game-restart values retain
their native timing. Journal preferences still save immediately through their
shared helpers. This difference is shown explicitly; putting a field under
Preferences does not itself choose its persistence or restart policy.

The catalog's current generic TOML forms are embedded rather than redirecting to
screens constructed solely for them. A genuine upstream screen can be a future
explicit destination when needed; use an honest Edit label and preserve its owner.
Do not create another generic modal merely to host a single field.

## Verification and updates

Run `./gradlew --no-daemon check build clientProbeJar`. Focused tests cover page
ownership/search, anchor reflow, strict JSON, integer/cross-field validation,
properties preservation, conflict retention, bounded/symlink/read-only refusal
and partial multi-file outcomes. Source checks do not replace native execution.

The existing client probe enables `-Dskyweave_compat.probe.configuration=true`
only in a disposable directory with `config-review-fixture.json`. Numbered commands
in `config-review-control.json` operate real screen clicks, keys, fields, wheel,
scrollbar dragging, GUI/window sizing and language reload. State records native
widgets, routes, bookmarks, JSON/startup drafts and feedback. Clear control/state
files between launches. The probe is not distributed with the mod.

Verify minimum/full client loading and dedicated-side exclusion; first/last
anchors and reflow; empty/localized search and inline registered fields; keyboard/scrollbar
input and narration structure; drafts across details/dialogs; real properties,
JSON and TOML saves/readback; external conflicts and invalid input. Confirm desktop
availability before focus/captures and retry interrupted attempts. Keep playing
worlds, configs, servers and LODs outside fixtures.

For Minecraft/NeoForge updates, recheck `ScrollPanel` clipping/focus/narration,
`EditBox` responder/caret/clipboard behavior, focus restoration, the uniform font resource for the information glyph, named palette colors,
registered value/spec save/reload events, TOML
parsing, watcher behavior and restart caches. For parser/profile updates, update
JSON catalog forms/strings and shared validators together. Check atomic replacement
on supported platforms, optional classloading, inline field ownership and journal
preferences through both entrances. Keep startup selection immutable and generation
identity checks authoritative; this UI is local configuration, not remote admin.
