# Island generation

The `create_sky_compat:islands_v1` preset owns the expanded terrain described here.
The [verification record](verification.md) distinguishes native observations from
unverified survival balance and vehicle capabilities.

## Ownership and scope

The preset owns its dimension type, noise settings and embedded Sky Archipelago
settings. Both height envelopes are `[-128, 768)`. The noise settings retain
Minecraft 1.21.1's Overworld router and surface definitions with the expanded
envelope. Sky Archipelago still supplies terrain filling and surface treatment;
this bypasses the complete vanilla terrain pipeline. Compat supplies its own interior
composition and connects the native large-vein material rule. Classic carving still
has a separate native aquifer query, described below.

`GeneratorProfileMixin` opts in only when the generator references the versioned
noise-settings key. It configures each field before returning it to a caller.
The field, sampler and descriptor factory share an immutable `GenerationProfile`;
there is no global current-world flag. Other presets retain upstream terrain.

The marked generator resolves its embedded settings on both dedicated servers and
singleplayer. Upstream otherwise gives a dedicated server's common TOML priority,
which would make the same preset produce different settings across runtimes.
The adapter preserves upstream resolution for every other generator. Missing
embedded settings fail explicitly rather than falling back to a host's defaults.

`IslandGeometry` retains upstream archetypes, horizontal shape noise and shape
parameters while separating anchor dimensions from companion radius/orbit ranges.
The spatial grid indexes candidates; accepted centers are displaced independently
on X and Z. Companions retain explicit source-cell ownership even when they cross
a cell boundary. Terrain fills, height queries, structure support and previews
consume the same accepted descriptors.

Main-island radii remain 270 to 370 blocks; companions retain radii 40 to 110
and orbits 470 to 680. Spires retain their native smaller dimensions. Each cluster
selects a uniform integer target height from 250 to 400 using its seed and a
separate salt. The anchor's cliff depth is target height minus plateau height and
32 blocks of relief/underside allowance. This is a target for the whole island,
not every column or a promise of exact realized height. Native cutouts, relief
and erosion still affect the measured extrema.

Placement uses each selected depth. Requested centers remain Y=200 to 490, but
tall bodies need a higher lower limit: at defaults a 400-block target requires
Y>=268, while a 250-block target can start at Y=200. The complete shape reserves
32 blocks above the floor and 200 above terrain. Companion elevations are fitted
independently. Terrain and geology are not compressed to fit.

`IslandDensityMixin` configures only fields belonging to this preset. It prepares
lower-body and horizontal bounds once per native column contribution, storing
them on the prepared density object. No global coordinate cache or extra noise
sampling per voxel is needed. The pinned upstream anchor rule subtracts a fixed
0.55 plus a depth term below `underside - 4`; the adapter removes that jump and
intersects the remaining native density with a continuous curved lower boundary.
An elliptical quadratic term and bounded eight-block noise vary the underside.
The existing native erosion and archetype coverage remain active. The taper stays
inside the selected body rather than extending a long tail beneath it.

All island families also have continuous radial support ending at
`2 * maxRadius + 32`. This is an explicit shape bound, not an inference from a
few sampled shores. It leaves nominal radii and companion orbits unchanged but
can remove an unusually distant native fringe. The maximum complete-cluster
reach is 933 blocks, including rounding of companion offsets. Clearance compares
the individual support disks of neighboring candidate clusters, rather than filling
that entire cluster envelope. Trees, structures and player construction are outside
this terrain-density guarantee. Actual shore distances are measured separately,
and missing clusters can create longer journeys.

The density mixins depend on Sky Archipelago 1.3.6's `prepareDensity`,
`samplePreparedDensity`, prepared-object lifetime, and underside penalty formula.
An upstream update requires inspecting those methods, reproducing the native
cutoff control, and rerunning bounds, silhouette, chunk/query and reopening checks.
Matching signatures alone is insufficient. Ordinary presets retain native density.

The native fresh-world fallback predicts a landing before carving/features have
necessarily left the same surface. `SpawnFallbackMixin` validates only its final
spawn assignment in this preset. `SpawnLanding` checks the generated chunk's
motion-blocking height, solid support, clear feet/head and fluids, then searches
bounded four-block offsets up to 16 blocks if necessary. It fails explicitly when
no landing exists. Chunk loads occur only during startup, never in the terrain
query path. Review the upstream fallback's event and saved-world guard when
updating; this hook must not relocate existing worlds.


Embedded settings retain biome eligibility, archetypes and structure policy.
Their serialized spacing is a placeholder: upstream caps that field at 2000,
while the field and sampler adapters own the real grid. Upstream common TOML,
DYNAMIC spacing and size/band controls do not override this preset's geometry.
See [configuration](../configuration.md) for authoritative controls.

## Cluster placement

`ClusterPlacementMixin` separates candidate construction from acceptance. A cell
first draws its activation and native archetype/companion descriptors. Biome
admission samples the displaced anchor at its surface datum. Ocean exclusion and
other upstream policy still apply; admission does not assign one biome to an island.
`IslandGeometry` retains the native shape noise and the configured vertical profile.

`ClusterLayout` assigns a stable priority to each eligible candidate. It rejects a
candidate if a higher-priority eligible neighbor has any island support disk closer
than `minimumClusterGap` to one of its disks. Exact-gap contact is permitted. Ties
are resolved by source-cell coordinates. Accepted clusters therefore cannot violate
the gap, including companion-to-companion approaches. The rule compares candidates,
never recursively accepted neighbors. It can discard a candidate whose winning
neighbor is itself rejected elsewhere; this trades some density for a bounded,
order-independent decision. It is not a maximal packing or a blue-noise guarantee.

The default uses ±750 independent X/Z offsets with a 2400-block candidate grid.
Activation precedes biome and clearance rejection, so it is not the realized
fraction of occupied cells. Larger jitter does not shrink islands or move rejected
candidates back toward cell centers.

The conflict neighborhood is bounded by
`ceil((2*jitter + 2*clusterReach + minimumClusterGap) / spacing)` cells. Point and
area lookups use `ceil((jitter + reach + ceil(spacing/2)) / spacing)`. Both are two
cells at defaults. Profile validation limits conflict searches to eight cells.
Village lookup includes its maximum supported placement reach and retry allowance.
Native density, column resolution, chunk snapshots, previews and geological lookup
use the derived bounds; none loads neighboring chunks to decide terrain. Candidate
and decision caches are separately capped at 8192 entries per field. Eviction may
repeat deterministic work but cannot change acceptance.

`ClusterField` provides accepted membership by source cell. A companion's position
is not its cluster ID. Geological mapping and the native survey use that membership;
spawn and optional village/delivery consumers query the accepted field.

![Native descriptor layouts at equal scale](cluster-layout.svg)

The comparison uses the same seed and vertical profile, but changes both horizontal
placement and the biome admission point. It is not a jitter-only experiment. The
[verification record](verification.md) reports alignment, density, clearance and
travel observations. Regenerate the figure with `tools/layout_report.py` from
native terrain reports; circles represent descriptor radii, not measured shores.

When updating Sky Archipelago, inspect `sampleCluster`, descriptor construction,
biome admission, cache keys, preview filtering and all three native search loops.
Verify that the density support bound still contains the generated terrain. A
matching method signature alone does not preserve these contracts. Changed layout
requires a new recorded algorithm identity and a fresh world.

## Columns and internal cavities

`IslandDensityEvaluator` combines footprint coverage, top/bottom windows, depth
narrowing, relief, edge erosion, channel noise and a small cavern-noise subtraction.
These are upstream shape terms, not Minecraft's complete noise-cave router.
`IslandColumnResolver` scans positive density into ordered solid intervals, then
applies `IslandOverlapResolver` before exposing a top-segment `ColumnProfile`.

The preset explicitly selects `OVERLAP`, retaining all exterior solid intervals.
`VOID` retains only the highest, while `CRATER` selectively modifies lower islands.
Cavity subtraction runs after this policy. It cannot make the overlap resolver
mistake a cavern floor for a separate island and discard it.

`IslandInteriors` evaluates each contributor separately within the admitted exterior.
It subtracts only that contributor's selected cavities, then unions the surviving
rock. A hole in one island cannot erase a different island. `LayeredColumn` retains
the original exterior intervals alongside the native post-cavity solid segments.
The native `ColumnProfile` remains an exterior-cap description. Solid-segment,
base-column, density-sign, top-solid-interval and support queries use actual baseline
rock. Saved blocks remain authoritative after classic carving, decoration or play.
`TerrainStage` scopes uncached planning reads to exterior or pre-water interior
columns. These reads bypass the final-column cache and restore their stage after
errors. Later planners can inspect earlier terrain without recursively invoking
themselves or consulting generated neighbor chunks.

Noise interiors combine intersecting noise bands and larger chambers. Hollow interiors
use an irregular chamber with three rock pillars. Descriptor-seeded selection also
admits occasional side passages and skylights. Vertical shell protection and a radial
shoulder limit constrain ordinary cavities; selected openings deliberately bypass that
shell. These are independently configured interiors, not new upstream exterior enums.
The existing taper and descriptor geometry remain unchanged.

Surface painting follows the exterior cap and skips cavity air/fluid instead of
refilling openings. Lush/dripstone projection tests the exterior envelope, including
interior air and retained lower bodies. Deep Dark and ancient-city eligibility retain
the upstream upper exterior's lower-quarter query; cavity roof thickness does not
replace its geological band. Native classic carving is separately configurable and
can alter the baseline after these queries. Queries never load neighboring chunks.

## Local water

`IslandWaters` admits descriptor-owned regions against uncached EXTERIOR columns.
An anchor's deterministic candidate supplies a basin center, level, radius, depth
and enclosed/overflow/outlet mode. Every floor and retaining-rim column must fit
inside the existing exterior; a coarse rejection precedes the full admission
scan. The bounded descriptor cache stores both admissions and rejections.

Water cuts occur during COMPLETE composition, before surviving contributors are
united. Another contributor's retained rock wins over a water source. Basin
lining restores only rock from the owning exterior, never unsupported new land.
`WaterColumn` carries source intervals separately from solid intervals into the
native material plan. Noise filling and base-column queries share those states;
surface height includes water while ocean-floor height tests actual solid blocks.
Wet beds use gravel/clay patches. These are local basins, not ocean habitats.

`WaterCarverMixin` preserves planned source water, lining and the retaining rim
during classic carving. Vanilla's carver replacement tag includes water, and its
aquifer can otherwise replace elevated sources with air. `WaterPostprocessing`
marks exposed sources during chunk filling using
pure neighbor-column queries. Minecraft's chunk postprocessing and fluid ticks
then create flows. Planning and preview reads neither load neighboring chunks nor
schedule ticks. Native springs may independently add water below a contained
basin, so a low water block alone is not evidence of a basin leak.

`WaterAnimalMixin` replaces the sea-level input only for native surface-water-animal
spawn checks inside planned basin water. `LocalWater` verifies the opted-in generator,
surviving source interval and basin footprint without reading neighboring chunks.
The native below/above-water predicates still apply. Biome spawn lists, available
space and population caps remain authoritative; this does not add ocean species to
an inland biome or change guardians, drowned or axolotl rules. Foreign generators,
waterfall columns and positions outside the region retain their native sea level.

When updating Minecraft or Sky Archipelago, inspect material-plan iteration,
heightmap predicates, carver replacement/fluid decisions, chunk postprocessing and
`WaterAnimal`'s spawn-height rule. Recheck initial fill, completed chunks and actual
fluid ticks separately. The saved identity records both water configuration and
the source/lining policy; do not reuse an older world marker after changing them.

## Ocean habitats

`OceanProfile` is an opt-in extension of local water, not a global ocean toggle.
Anchor candidates select enclosed or coastal basins; eligible small companions
can instead receive a flat water-covered cap with open edges. An ocean candidate
takes precedence over that descriptor's freshwater selection. Anchor admission
checks every floor/rim column against existing exterior rock. A companion cap
retains its lower body and only fills cells belonging to that contributor; another
contributor's surviving rock still wins at intersections.

`OceanBiomes` projects stored ocean cells near the planned water volume while the
upstream biome-fill scope is active. It selects warm, ordinary, cold or frozen
ocean from the original biome's base temperature. Coastal regions can project a
beach along nearby low ground; distant terrain and deep cave cells retain their
previous biome path. Geometry planning uses the existing sampling guard to avoid
reentering biome projection. Sand/gravel beds and native ocean-biome decoration
provide substrate and vegetation; water-animal height checks use the local level.
These are explicit habitat prototypes, not a replacement climate sampler or a
promise of monument, guardian or sponge access.

The upstream [1.3.3 release notes](https://modrinth.com/mod/sky-archipelago/version/1.3.3)
limit water structures to the ocean layer and describe floating-island support as
future work. Its [project overview](https://modrinth.com/mod/sky-archipelago) describes
the early creative-first scope and planned lakes, but also contains older cave
limitations that do not describe all of 1.3.6's implementation. The inspected code,
rather than that historical overview, establishes the current palette and projection
behavior. The inference guiding these adapters is that upstream provides configurable
sky terrain, while local survival habitats need additional material, biome and fluid
coordination; vanilla hydrology is not an implicit upstream contract.

## Large veins

`IslandVeins` invokes Minecraft's `OreVeinifier` with the preset's toggle,
ridge and gap definitions bound to the existing `RandomState` noises. It does not
replace nodes in C2ME's compiled runtime router. Interpolated markers use the noise settings' cell dimensions
and Minecraft's Y/X/Z interpolation order. Samples and positional randomness use
island-relative reference depth; the material rule keeps native thresholds, granite/
copper and tuff/iron composition, and raw-ore blocks. A thread retains at most one
cell per interpolated noise. Cache state does not affect query order or chunk seams.

Only surviving stone/deepslate is eligible. Air and water cannot acquire vein blocks.
The same material plan serves fill and base-column queries. Ordinary placed ore
features run afterward and retain their counts, replacement predicates and mapped
heights. This adapter does not add large zinc or platinum veins. The preset's
`ore_veins_enabled` controls this material path; the flag alone was insufficient
while the custom fill bypassed Minecraft's native vein rule.

When updating Minecraft, review `OreVeinifier`, `RandomState`, `NoiseChunk` marker
wrapping/interpolation and the vein functions in the preset. Verify native generated
raw blocks, reference-depth distributions, fill/query agreement and reopening.

## Surface and generation stages

Sky Archipelago 1.3.6 replaces `fillFromNoise` with `SkyIslandTerrainPass` column
material plans. It updates `OCEAN_FLOOR_WG` and `WORLD_SURFACE_WG` during filling;
`getBaseColumn` uses the same material plan. The upstream `getBaseHeight`
prediction does not distinguish heightmap predicates. Compat resolves those
predicates against its material column where local source water makes the water
surface differ from the solid floor. These baseline queries are not substitutes
for completed chunk heightmaps after trees, fluid updates or structures.

`buildSurface` runs `SkyIslandSurfacePass`, not the complete vanilla
`SurfaceSystem`. `SurfaceBlockSelector` chooses a soil/cliff palette from upstream
override tags, vanilla biome tags and temperature/biome heuristics. It supplies
sand/gravel shores, red sand/terracotta in badlands, mycelium and snowy surfaces,
then blends supported structure bases and mineshaft chains. This is not vanilla
badlands banding/pillars, swamp hydrology or powder-snow terrain. A noise-settings
surface-rule JSON does not make those features execute here.

Compat adds tagged mangrove mud at the actual surface-write boundary. Upstream's
`SurfaceMaterial` enum would otherwise convert a custom mud layer back into its
fixed palette. `BiomeMaterials` changes only the upper three grass/dirt soil blocks;
upstream override tags win, and the existing opening/fluid guard still applies.
The resolved mud-biome tag is part of saved generation identity.
Carving can separately consult native surface rules to repair exposed top material.
Mods adding surface rules need a review of the consuming stage, not just a tag.

Classic carving, biome decoration, structure references, light/postprocessing and
initial mob population retain Minecraft's chunk-stage machinery. Initial population
uses `NoiseBasedChunkGenerator.spawnOriginalMobs` and native heightmap/support
checks; no separate island mob ecology is implemented. Structure spawn overrides
remain native. Fresh-preset generation is supported; vanilla terrain blending and
below-zero retrogen are not an old-world migration path.

## Geological frame

`GeologicalFrame` maps reference Y=−64 to the anchor's `centerY - cliffDepth`
and reference Y=64 to `centerY + plateauHeight + 1`. Underground heights scale between
those points with integer floor division. Heights above reference 64 retain a
one-block-to-one-block offset above that surface datum. Vanilla's build ceiling
is not treated as ordinary ground level. Samples outside `[-64, 320)` are rejected,
not clamped. The inverse uses the same piecewise model for cave biomes and ore
reporting.

The frame is shared across an anchor, its shorelines and companions; a shallow
companion does not acquire a complete compressed ore column. The datum is not the
actual surface of every column. Relief and erosion remain meaningful: upper iron,
coal and emerald attempts can land in air, while attempts below the datum remain
in the deep body where replacement rules permit them. Native counts are unchanged.

`OreHeightMixin` intercepts the existing height modifier only for features in
`#create_sky_compat:relative_geology`, inside the opted-in generator. It samples
the original height provider against an explicit reference context. Absolute,
bottom-relative and top-relative anchors retain their original meaning. It
consumes the sample even when the target column is void, then maps successful
samples. Counts, feature order, biome checks, configured veins, replacement rules
and exposure probabilities remain native. Nether/End and unlisted placements
are unchanged. Feature-internal checks remain native. Fossils still fit their selected template
below the local heightmap and reject excessive empty corners. Standalone jungle
vines use a separate `relative_surface` tag: reference 64 to 100 becomes actual
column top through top+36, preserving their neighbor-attachment test. Blue ice is
not moved: its native feature requires water, packed ice and a position below sea
level, which this oceanless preset does not provide naturally. Moving its origin
would not supply that environment. Ocean-specific content is not guaranteed.

The tag includes vanilla Overworld ores, underground clay, both fossil placements,
geological patches, Create zinc and
Overworld striated deposits, and Propulsion platinum. Mod entries are optional
registry references; their absence does not invalidate the datapack.

Geodes, Overworld water/lava springs and underground lava lakes use the same
height-placement adapter. Native rarity/count modifiers, environmental scans,
surface-distance checks and feature geometry remain intact. Surface-heightmap
vegetation is not moved through the ore frame. Cave vegetation, dripstone, sculk,
underground monster rooms, glow lichen and underwater magma use their native
height providers through the same adapter. Environmental checks remain native.

Material plans map their deepslate test through the same frame. Terrain fill and
base-column queries use the same adapter, retaining the native transition noise.
The preset's deepslate transition is expressed at reference Y=0. Frame lookup uses
cached terrain descriptors and bounded cell searches; it never loads chunks.

## Carving

Vanilla cave origins sample the reference envelope and map through the geological
frame at their source chunk's center. Canyon origins instead preserve their native
10 to 67 height spread relative to the actual local surface at reference Y=64. That fixed origin
frame is shared by every target chunk carved by the same tunnel. Tunnel lengths,
branching and shapes remain native. A void origin consumes the native random
sample and subsequent tunnel decisions below the playable envelope; it cannot
manufacture a new geological frame at an island edge.

The lava-floor anchor resolves through the frame at each carved block. The real
carving context retains the full dimension bounds; canyon width arrays and native
clipping therefore still use valid world coordinates. No neighboring chunks are
loaded for these lookups. Other generators retain their original provider calls.
This restores classic carvers within island rock; it does not introduce vanilla's
noise-cave or aquifer terrain-filling systems.

There is a narrower unresolved fluid distinction: delegated `applyCarvers` creates
a native `NoiseChunk`, and `WorldCarver.getCarveState` consults its aquifer above
the mapped lava floor. Those noise/sea-level inputs still use world coordinates;
only the explicit lava anchor is mapped. This does not create a full aquifer during
island filling, but it prevents claiming that all carved fluids are island-relative.
A future fluid-policy change needs matched low/high island samples, containment and
exposed-side checks. It must not introduce global water to repair an origin height.

## Cave biomes

During native chunk biome filling, lush and dripstone cave footprints are sampled
at island-relative reference depth. Projection requires an existing solid column
and leaves its upper 16 blocks to the original surface biome. It shares the anchor
geological frame with ore placement; thin companions do not gain an independent
complete cave-biome column.

The adapter extends Sky Archipelago's existing projection scope and recursion
protection. Its Deep Dark projection retains priority and upstream behavior.
Lush/dripstone projection does not extend to direct structure eligibility queries;
adding structures that require those biomes needs a separate placement review.
Vanilla cave decoration retains its own ground, ceiling, water and space checks.

## Feature coverage and limits

Height-range tags adapt origins, not every algorithm inside a feature. The resolved
registry and typed selector traversal are checked with the native coverage probe.
Trees, flowers, crop patches and surface lakes primarily use actual heightmaps,
soil/fluid predicates and local offsets. Root systems, vegetation patches and
selectors retain their nested placements. Cave decoration searches real floors,
ceilings and available space; moving its origin does not guarantee a suitable cave.
Geodes, springs and underground lakes retain native shape and enclosure rejection.
Monster rooms retain floor/wall/opening checks. Fossils fit below the local heightmap
and reject excessive empty corners. No scan range or feature geometry is stretched
with the geological frame.

Create's `LayeredOreFeature` checks the actual ocean-floor heightmap, replaceability
and exposure; it has no extra fixed-Y cutoff. Almost Unified rewrites
`OreConfiguration` targets, not the generic layered feature. Its removal of an
empty unified feature would need rechecking after mod/config updates. Propulsion's
three bottom-relative platinum distributions partly sample below reference −64;
those attempts remain rejected, rather than being clamped into extra ore.

Oceanless generation excludes ocean hosts and reports sea level at the build floor.
Icebergs reset their origin to sea level; blue ice also needs water and packed ice.
Kelp, seagrass, coral and sea pickles need suitable water/substrate. Wandering traders
provide kelp, sea pickles, coral blocks, packed/blue ice and nautilus shells, but that
is not a claim of natural habitat or a complete substitute for ocean progression.
Monuments, guardian farms and sponge access need an explicit pack acquisition policy
if required. Adding an ocean or replacement recipes remains a separate design choice.

Sky Archipelago's registered `IceSpikeFeatureMixin` replaces vanilla spike placement
with `SkyIslandIceSpikeFeature.placeWithoutVanillaRoot`. It removes the long root
loop, so vanilla's fixed Y=50 root cutoff is not an active defect in this stack.
This also illustrates why a resolved feature class alone does not establish its
transformed behavior. Other native predicates and future foreign feature classes
need their own review; tagged origins are not universal height remapping.

## Structures

Sky Archipelago owns structure categories, host selection, fit checks, relocation,
references, locate support and postprocessing. Strongholds retain its compact-graph
pruning; trial chambers and mineshafts retain its underground fit rules. Ancient
cities use its **surface** placement route on a host selected through Deep Dark
eligibility. The expanded preset does not turn that route into a buried city.

`AncientCityBiomeMixin` scopes only the registered `minecraft:ancient_city` in the
expanded preset. Upstream samples a column midpoint before generation, above its
own lower-45% Deep Dark band, then tests the original Jigsaw stub height before
relocation. `AncientCityProjectionMixin` makes both checks sample the lower quarter
of the column through the existing projector. It recomputes the base biome at that
height, retains the fixed reference-Y−48 footprint and anchor-family restriction,
and restores both query scope and recursion guard on exit. Geometry queries do
not load chunks. Stored biomes, template geometry, support rejection and other
structure queries remain unchanged.

Updating Sky Archipelago requires checking `StructureGenerationAttemptService`'s
two scoped entry points, both projector overloads, column/quart rounding and the
ancient-city surface route. Verify positive and negative biome checks, scope exit,
ordinary-generator exclusion, native placement and realized blocks. Registry or
layout acceptance alone does not prove that postprocessing produced usable content.

`StructureLocateCheckMixin` corrects the native `StructureCheck` fallback preview.
That preview tests a layout at its original source chunk, while the upstream
planner can relocate it to a valid island. A failed preview could therefore hide
an existing valid start. For this preset, unknown permitted candidates request
`STRUCTURE_STARTS` resolution instead. Loaded/saved results and placement
restrictions stay authoritative; denylisted and ocean-disabled WATER candidates
remain excluded. This is not unconditional acceptance or a FULL-chunk request.

This increases work for some unsuccessful lookups. Search radius and candidate
selection stay native; broad searches in sparse worlds can still be expensive.
Locate coordinates remain upstream's X/Z target and may retain Y=0. They are not
validated landings. Review `StructureCheck.checkStart/canCreateStructure`, upstream
category policy and reference registration together when updating dependencies.

Upstream routes vanilla villages through its ground-village planner; outposts and
portals use surface/small-island routes, while other surface structures can use
DEFAULT anchoring and specialized adapters. Shipwreck pieces explicitly suppress
late height re-anchoring after island placement, explaining valid land wrecks
without a new airship generator. Monuments and ocean ruins use WATER placement and
are rejected with oceans disabled. A missing start in a bounded search is not proof
of a missing implementation. Lootr conversion occurs after chunk loading and server
ticks, not synchronously when a structure's chest block is first placed.

## Climate and villages

Temperature comparisons use reference Y=64 throughout this preset. Climate follows
biome rather than absolute altitude: a high temperate island does not become snowy
solely because it is high. This also keeps multiplayer client weather and server
freezing consistent without reconstructing server terrain or exposing its seed.
Altitude cooling above a mountain is deliberately absent in this preset. The
adapter changes only temperature-query positions; light, fluid, terrain and block
coordinates retain their real altitude. It covers Sky Archipelago surface
selection, ruined-portal cold classification, vanilla snow/freezing predicates,
precipitation ticks, rain exposure
and the client's weather rendering/sounds. Native snow rendering was checked
with shaders enabled and disabled. Surface selectors receive a bounded thread-local context from
the owning surface pass because their API has no world argument; `finally`
restores it across nested calls and failures. No biome temperature is mutated.


Surface generation and player-facing biome queries do not use identical sampling.
Sky Archipelago chooses materials from stored quart biomes at the surface;
Minecraft's smoothed biome lookup can select a neighboring cell. Upstream explicit
snow tags and cold-biome rules can also choose snowy ground independently of the
temperature adaptation. Its river/beach terrain-profile blending does not smooth
general biome boundaries.

A reported grainy snow pattern has no confirmed location or affected version.
Contiguous surface probes distinguish stored biomes, smoothed lookups, unprojected
biomes, snow blocks, snow layers and precipitation. They retain cold weather and
do not globally smooth biomes to hide boundaries. See the verification record for
observations and remaining uncertainty.

Sky Villages keep their authored start-height spread, shifted from the old
Y=192 datum to the new anchor surface datum. Only the named structure and the
opted-in generator receive this adjustment. Horizontal clearance still uses the
complete generated footprint.

Each archipelago has an allowance of zero to three villages, with zero common
and three rare. The logarithmic-series weights are
`96:24:8:3`, or approximately 73.3%, 18.3%, 6.1% and 2.3%. `VillageDistribution`
implements the deterministic count draw. `ArchipelagoVillagePlacement` replaces
only the named village's runtime placement inside the opted-in generator. It
selects stable random-spread candidates per anchor; it never uses mutable accepted
counters or chunk visitation order. Companion islands do not receive separate
quotas. Layout, biome and clearance rejection can reduce the realized count.

The candidate grid uses 24-chunk spacing and 12-chunk separation. A candidate
belongs to the nearest anchor, with coordinate tie-breaking. It must pass a cheap
center-biome eligibility check before selection. Seeded ranking selects at most
the anchor's allowance, leaving at least 384 blocks between its candidate centers.
Native Jigsaw still checks the actual start-piece center biome and native layouts
still pass complete-footprint clearance. The preliminary ring reserves 128 blocks
for layout extent; it does not replace the final terrain check. Original salt,
spread type, frequency, exclusion-zone checks and locate behavior are retained.
Registered structure sets and ordinary Sky Archipelago worlds remain unchanged.

Candidate admission also reserves a 192-block square inside the anchor's nearest-
center region: 32 blocks for upstream SKY biome retries and 160 for layout extent.
The final layout must retain the same nearest anchor as its native start. This
prevents a village assigned to one cluster from consuming space beside another
cluster with a different allowance. Review these bounds when changing Sky Villages'
start pool or Jigsaw radius, or Sky Archipelago's source-retry search.

## Delivery endpoints

When Aeronautics Delivery Quests 1.1.1 is installed, the adapter changes its
structure-route loading, distance checks and surface finalization only in the
opted-in preset. RANDOM routing and foreign generators retain native behavior.

The background FULL chunk requests need retained tickets in the installed stack.
Without them, native futures can complete with an `Unloaded chunk` result that
ADQ ignores. `DeliveryChunks` holds a 3×3 chunk neighborhood for each endpoint,
at most 18 unique chunks per generation job, and waits for successful FULL results.
Loading remains asynchronous, with a 60-second timeout. Tickets are released on
registration, rejection, load failure or server shutdown. No chunk ticket is
stored in the world or retained for the accepted quest's lifetime. ADQ's single
active generation job is part of this version-coupled contract.
Native generation may request additional neighboring chunks at intermediate
statuses; 18 is the owned ticket bound, not a total generated-chunk budget.

The origin and route minimum-distance checks use horizontal distance. Native
locators can report Y=0 before realization and the actual surface Y afterward;
counting that difference admitted a one-block route as more than 500 blocks long.
The configured maximum still bounds the sampled search offset, not the final
located route. Surface retries can move the selected positions by a few blocks.

Native valid surface endpoints are returned unchanged. If an endpoint is rejected in the opted-in
preset and its loaded chunk contains a Sky Village start, the adapter searches
at most eight blocks around it, in deterministic rings. Every retry uses ADQ's
original dry-surface test and must remain inside the village's bounding box.
Void, fluids, leaves and uneven 3×3 surfaces remain rejected by that native test.

The existing locator can return a start chunk corner beside void even when the
village has valid nearby ground. This adapter changes endpoint selection, not
structure placement, cargo, rewards or RANDOM-mode routing. Search is bounded
and occurs during quest finalization, not terrain generation. Native surface
queries stay within the retained endpoint neighborhoods; this is not a landing planner.
If no valid nearby surface exists, ADQ retains its failure behavior.

The dependency is optional and version-guarded. Review the private methods before
changing ADQ: each of the surface, chunk-request and distance wrappers requires
exactly two call sites. Registration and failure entry points own lease cleanup.
Do not remove surface checks or expand the search into unrelated terrain to make
a route succeed. A generated vanilla-village offer was accepted and its cargo spawned natively.
Sky Village cargo placement and delivery completion remain separate play checks.

## Atmosphere

The preset uses a Sable dimension-physics data record under
`data/create_sky_compat/dimension_physics/islands_v1.json`. A narrow lookup adapter
selects that profile only for this dimension type. Sable's native loader and
network packet carry the record; no custom packet or global Overworld override is
needed. A higher-priority explicit dimension record remains authoritative.

The pressure curve starts at 1.5 below the islands, reaches 1.0 at the Y=508 pressure
reference, 0.8 at Y=600, 0.5 at Y=680 and zero at the exclusive ceiling of Y=768.
Its cubic interpolation is checked across every integer altitude for bounded,
monotonic pressure. Gravity, drag and magnetic north retain Sable's defaults.
Native aircraft behavior still requires separate flight checks; successful data
loading or interpolation alone cannot validate a ship design.

## Saved worlds

Before levels load, `GenerationGuard` records the seed, algorithm revision,
geometry parameters, resolved embedded settings, village policy and structure set,
biome source, noise settings, dimension and the ancient-city eligibility policy
in `create-sky-generation.json` within a new world's directory. Object keys are
canonicalized so map iteration cannot change the identity. Reopening with a
different identity fails before generation. Existing region files without an
identity are not adopted. Replacing the generator in a marked world is rejected.

The city eligibility correction records `ancientCityEligibility: lower_quarter_v1`.
Terrain geometry keeps its existing algorithm identity, but worlds recorded before
this structure-policy field are rejected rather than silently mixing city placement
rules. Use a new test world or its original artifact; the locate-only correction
does not independently change generated content.

There is no conversion or automatic marker rewrite. Restore a world's original
settings/mod version or create a separate world. Deleting the marker is not a
migration procedure. Changes to the generation algorithm require reviewing its
revision and compatibility contract before release.

## Native checks

`tools/probe.py --terrain --samples 4` compares actual registered-preset density
samples over four layout seeds. These are predictions before carving/features, with sampled
volume estimates rather than full island block counts.

`--generation current|adapted|vanilla --seed N` generates two bounded interior
samples of nine chunks each using the installed server's mod selection. It records
actual blocks and ore counts by reference depth. For Sky Archipelago generators,
it also fills standalone native ProtoChunks and compares every block with base-
column queries. Those isolated chunks cannot race C2ME surface/feature workers.
Full generated chunks are inspected separately because surface and ore features
legitimately replace predicted stone and deepslate.

`--islands --seed N` samples one deterministic random chunk from each cell of a
7×7 grid inside twice each of three nearby anchor radii. Counts include only
columns dominated by that anchor. Weighting each chunk by its stratum's chunk
count yields a bounded-area estimate, not an exact island inventory. Reports keep
observed counts and estimates separate, plus reference-depth ore bins, surface
biomes, headroom, spawn support/clearance, descriptors, timing and end-of-run heap.
Native cell membership also exports exact companion groups and geological frames.
An eight-block-or-finer center-line density sample records its longest void gap.
Descriptor edge gaps and sampled straight routes are approximations, not navigated
or altitude-safe crossings.

`--biomes --seed N` locates native cave-biome footprints and checks stored chunk
biomes, surface preservation and actual cave decoration in generated chunks.

`--water --seed N --fluid-ticks 600` finds one admitted region per water mode,
compares native fill/base-column states and both water/solid height predicates,
then loads bounded areas for real fluid ticks. It checks floor/rim integrity,
flow at intended outlets and the local water-animal height predicate, including
out-of-region and foreign-generator controls. Zero ticks runs only material
checks. Selected witnesses do not measure world-wide basin frequency or prove
aquatic spawn populations. `--interiors` distinguishes exterior, pre-water interior,
final rock and source-water intervals when comparing independent query orders.

`--reopen` repeats the generated sample after saving and restarting the same
throwaway world, requiring unchanged ore counts or natural village observations.
The village fixture checks all selected sites in a 12,000-block descriptor survey,
native locate, ownership, complete footprints, fresh reverse-order planning and two
fully generated villages. Successful reports identify the
exact mod/probe JAR hashes. Reports and logs live under ignored `build/verification`.
The runner removes its temporary world. Never pass a live save as a test target.

Before changing upstream versions, inspect generator caching, descriptor records,
column/material planning and placement modifier call paths. Rerun native Mixin,
foreign-preset, bounds, query agreement and reopening checks, then the full resource
and gameplay surveys. Build success alone does not validate an injection target.
