# Skyweave Compat

Optional terrain, gameplay, and rendering adaptations for Minecraft 1.21.1.
Every adaptation has a startup switch. The Skyweave modpack is not required.

## Installation

Install this mod with **Java 21 and NeoForge 21.1.264 or later in the 21.1 series**.
No content mod is required. With no supported targets installed, no adapters activate.
Use it on the client for rendering fixes; install it on both sides with matching
configuration when using the expanded island preset.

Edit `config/skyweave_compat-features.properties` before startup to disable
unwanted features. Changes require a full process restart. Disabled adaptations
select no target mixins, callbacks, or data packs and do not constrain target
versions. An enabled adaptation activates only when its full dependency combination
is present on the applicable side; unsupported active combinations fail clearly.
See [all switches and supported combinations](docs/configuration.md#adaptation-switches).

Remove Veil Iris Fix when enabling the incorporated framebuffer adaptation.
Remove Sky Village Neighbors when enabling Compat's village adaptations.
Upstream mods retain their own dependencies. Create/Propulsion ore IDs are optional
members of the relative-placement tags, not required mods.

No world preset is selected automatically. To use the expanded terrain, install
Sky Archipelago and create a new world with **Skyweave Islands**, or set
`level-type=skyweave_compat:islands_v1` before creating a dedicated-server world.
Do not change an existing save's generator or recorded generation configuration.
Ordinary Sky Archipelago worlds receive only applicable enabled adaptations.

The rendering adapters have background checks and native macOS shader, Ponder,
balloon, and single-block glass comparisons. The original flickering/gapped airship
shadow report remains unresolved; this is not a general shadow correction.
The Analog Audio registration fix likewise does not establish moving playback or
GUI behavior. See [verification](docs/development/verification.md) for exact scope.

[Playback synchronization](docs/development/audio.md) and
[construct grave recovery](docs/development/recovery.md) are separate adaptations.
They preserve upstream media and inventory ownership; neither requires island
generation. Recovery keeps its metadata in YiGD's saved grave records.

See [redstone editing and gate behavior](docs/development/redstone.md) for relocation
limits, analog signal changes and pack-owned resource fixes.

## Linear Bearing

Independent switches repair dedicated startup and gum drops, passive-guide braking
and recovery, magnetic/spring kinetic transmission, and gyro sensing. Links use
Create's real source and stress network. The gyro supplies a signal with zero
stress capacity. Linear Bearings Fix 1.0.3 can remain installed; Compat defers its
overlapping startup/drop repairs. Read [machinery contracts and dependency
ownership](docs/development/linear-bearing.md) before changing or removing these adapters.

Optional Ponder scenes explain assembly, motion, braking, recovery, transmission,
and sensing. Jade shows actual brake/link state with extra detail on demand.
Both integrations can be disabled independently; neither makes Ponder or Jade
a mandatory dependency.

## Colorwheel

Colorwheel supplies Iris-aware Flywheel backends for compatible shaders. It does
not replace the framebuffer, single-block-pass or moving-light adaptations.
With Colorwheel installed, separate client switches release unused OIT texture
slots on unsupported renderers and extend construct material annotations to its
terrain/emission protocol. Ordinary world annotations and
backend selection remain Colorwheel's responsibility. See
[rendering](docs/development/rendering.md#colorwheel) for boundaries and updates.

## Moving lights

With Sable Dynamic Lights and LambDynamicLights installed, independent client
adaptations repair the selected Sodium API, keep transient illumination out of
integrated-server lighting and clear Create light owners when leaving a world. Neither requires the island preset or Iris. These are optional
repairs, not another lighting engine or a general cabin-occlusion fix. See
[lighting](docs/development/lighting.md) for dependencies and known limits.

## Distant terrain

DH generates and renders distant terrain through its ordinary pipeline. Compat
adds focused lifecycle fixes and optional per-save cache isolation; it does not
provide a separate terrain predictor. Existing DH cache keys
remain unchanged by default. See [DH configuration](docs/configuration.md#distant-horizons)
and [integration boundaries](docs/development/lod.md).

## Journal

With Questlog installed, conditions wrap and rewards can be inspected before an
entry is complete. Separate tabs preserve access to both. Scrollbars use the
content length; narrow windows show one section at a time. Item imagery and
condition symbols are controlled through an attached Settings bookmark, alongside
notification preferences. Questlog still owns objectives,
progress, reward grants and replaceable interface textures.

Journal notifications announce first observed objective progress and completion,
not prerequisite unlocks. Completing an entry immediately suppresses its start
notification. Reward collection remains explicit. The interface and notifications
work on clients connected to ordinary Questlog servers; invalid reward-request
protection requires Compat on the server. See [journal settings](docs/configuration.md#questlog)
and [contracts and limitations](docs/development/questlog.md).

## Island terrain

**Skyweave Islands** uses a build range from Y=-128 through Y=767. Clusters have
large anchor islands surrounded by smaller companions. Default anchor height
targets are 250 to 400 blocks, with placement fitted to leave floor clearance and
building headroom. Ore placement, large iron/copper veins and classic cave carvers
use island-relative heights rather than vanilla world altitude. The preset retains
stacked exterior terrain and offers baseline, noise-cave and hollow interiors with
separate controls for openings and native carving. Local basins can retain water,
overflow into channels or feed falls through deliberate underside openings.
Ancient-city eligibility uses a consistent
Deep Dark column query, and structure lookup resolves relocated starts instead of
rejecting them from their original source biome. Vanilla terrain systems are not
all reproduced; the [coverage limits](docs/development/terrain.md#feature-coverage-and-limits)
describe ocean content, fluids and native feature behavior.

The default candidate grid is 2400 blocks, with up to 750 blocks of displacement
in each horizontal axis. Accepted centers do not follow fixed spacing;
activation, biome eligibility, clearance and island shapes affect
actual travel distances. See [configuration](docs/configuration.md) for controls
and [terrain](docs/development/terrain.md) for implementation limits.

## Placement

The default rule requires at least **64 blocks** between the village's full
horizontal bounds and predicted island terrain. It also requires a sampled terrain
column within **512 blocks** belonging to an island with a native radius of at
least **96 blocks**. These distances are measured between block columns, not from
the village center.

The expanded preset shifts villages into its island altitude band and assigns
each archipelago zero to three villages, weighted toward zero. Buildings and loot
remain unchanged. Biome and terrain rejection can reduce the actual count. The
neighbor rule does not move villages onto islands or create roads. Ordinary Sky
Archipelago presets keep their original height and frequency. Existing generated
villages and regular villages are unaffected by the neighbor rule.

The host search uses a 16-block grid. It may miss a narrow eligible part of an
island and reject that candidate. Clearance checks every column in the exclusion
band, so that approximation cannot admit a village overlapping terrain. Terrain
predictions do not include later structures or player-built blocks.

## Configuration

Open **Mods → Skyweave Compat → Config** for one scrollable page of categories,
mod-specific settings and fix status. Sidebar links jump to sections. Journal preferences apply immediately; fix changes save for the
next startup. The menu edits local files, not a connected server.

Feature switches remain in `config/skyweave_compat-features.properties`.
Village tuning uses `config/skyweave_compat-common.toml`. Island geometry lives in
`config/skyweave_compat-generation.json`; cavity and native-carver controls live in
`config/skyweave_compat-interiors.json`, and local basins use
`config/skyweave_compat-water.json`. Restart the game/server after changes;
changed generation settings require a fresh world.
The server's configuration controls multiplayer generation.

See [configuration](docs/configuration.md) for controls and limitations,
[development](docs/development/README.md) for builds and verification, and
[publishing](docs/publishing.md) for release instructions.
